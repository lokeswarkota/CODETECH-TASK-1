## PROJECCT OVERVIEW

### Title: LED Blinking with Arduino

#### Description
This project involves programming an Arduino board to blink an LED at a specific interval. It serves as an introduction to basic embedded programming concepts and interfacing with hardware. This project was completed entirely online using Tinkercad, a platform for 3D design, electronics, and coding.

#### Objective
The main objective of this project is to understand the basics of embedded programming and hardware interfacing by controlling an LED with an Arduino board. This foundational project helps in grasping essential concepts such as digital output, timing functions, and basic circuit setup.

#### Key Activities
1. **Circuit Setup in Tinkercad**: Set up a virtual circuit using Tinkercad.
2. **Programming the Arduino**: Write a sketch (program) to make the LED blink.
3. **Timing Control**: Adjust the interval at which the LED blinks by modifying the delay in the code.
4. **Simulation**: Simulate the circuit and code in Tinkercad to verify functionality.

#### Technologies Used
- **Arduino Board (Virtual)**: The microcontroller used to control the LED in the Tinkercad simulation.
- **LED (Virtual)**: The light-emitting diode controlled in the Tinkercad simulation.
- **Arduino IDE (Online)**: The integrated development environment used to write the code for the Arduino board in Tinkercad.
- **Tinkercad**: An online platform for 3D design, electronics, and coding, used to simulate the project.

#### Components Needed (Virtual)
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LED


#### Steps:

1. **Circuit Setup in Tinkercad**:
   - Go to [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and create a new project.
   - Place an Arduino and an LED in the Tinkercad workspace.
   - Connect the longer leg (anode) of the LED to a digital pin (e.g., pin 13) on the Arduino.
   - Connect the shorter leg (cathode) of the LED to the ground (GND) on the Arduino.

2. **Programming the Arduino**:
   - In Tinkercad, open the code editor.
   - Write the  code.

3. **Simulation**:
   - Start the simulation in Tinkercad.
   - Observe the LED blinking at one-second intervals.
